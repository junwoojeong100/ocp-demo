# tekton-demo

This repository is for simple hands-on labs to build CI pipelines including git clone, maven build, docker build & push based on Tekton.

In addition, there are sample pipelines using S2I build.

In the future, it would be good to develop this repo for various kinds of CI pipelines based on customer requirements.
